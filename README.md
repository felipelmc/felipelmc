### Hi there! 👋🏼 I'm Felipe Lamarca and...

I study Data Science and AI at [FGV EMAp](https://emap.fgv.br/en) and Social Sciences at [FGV CPDOC](https://cpdoc.fgv.br/en). I was born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 🇧🇷, and I'm a proud Carioca.

- ☕ I'm interested in Statistical Modeling, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Computational Social Sciences
- 👨🏻‍🔬 I'm really into modeling complex phenomena and getting to the bottom of why they happen the way they do
- 📚 I've been studying more about Bayesian statistics and multilevel modeling
- 🎮 Other than that, I'm also into playing video games[^1] and (sometimes) exercising
